-   section 112
    -   2 types of errors
        -   operational, problems that we can predict will happen eventually, so we handle them in advance
            -   invalid path accessed
            -   invalid user input (validator error from mongoose)
            -   failed to connect to server or db
            -   request timeout, etc
            -   GOAL, have middleware setup to handle incoming errors, so we can send a good response to client
        -   programming errors, bugs we devs introduce into our code, more difficult to find and handle
            -   reading undefined variables
            -   passing a number where an object is expected
            -   using await without async
            -   using req.query instead of req.body, etc
